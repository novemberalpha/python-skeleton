# python-skeleton
This is a starter set for python projects taken entirely from [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/python/).

1. Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Name it after your new project
2. From the command line cd into your new directory. `cd NEWPROJECT`
3. Delete the Skeleton git info. `rm -rf .git`
4. Rename (move) the NAME directory to be the name of your project or whatever you want to call your root module
5. Edit your setup.py to have all the information for your project
6. Rename tests/NAME_tests.py to also have your module name
7. Double check it's all working by using `nosetests` again
8. Delete README.md. `rm README.md`
9. Initialize git. `git init`
10. Start coding
